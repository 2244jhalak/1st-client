            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">About Canada</h5>
            <hr class="pb-2" style="width: 150px;">
            <p class="pb-2">Canada is the second largest country geographically in the world after Russia and has a
                population of 34,834,841 people.
                There are two official languages – English and French. Canada is a federal nation with ten provinces and
                three
                territories. Climate varies from +30 degrees Celsius in the summer months, to -20 degrees Celsius in the
                winter months.
                Canadian nature is well known all over the world. Canadian, mountains, lakes, rivers, forests make
                people feel
                themselves like in a huge National Park. Bordering with USA and possessing valuable natural resources
                helps Canada to
                maintain its economics on a very high level. The main destinations for tourists are: Toronto, Ottawa,
                Vancouver, Quebec
                and Montreal. During the winter tourists can enjoy skiing on the stretching mountains.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                Canada is known throughout the world for its multiculturalism and for promoting the concept of “salad
                bowl”. In Canada,
                people from all cultures mingle and retain their identity, forming a large web of multicultural
                diversity. Canada is
                widely known for spending more per capita on its education system, than any other country in the
                Organization for
                Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Canadian universities and institutions are widely known for
                providing
                superior quality of education.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                There are a large number of universities in Canada, which provide high quality education to students.
                Along with
                universities, there are also several other community colleges and technical institutions which provide
                vocational
                programs to get a job. These universities and institutions offer over 8,000 programmes at 150 public
                institutions.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                Canadian universities have been a host to a large student population from around the world. Students
                gather to Canada,
                because Canadian universities deliver the best knowledge to the students.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                The tuition fee of Canadian universities is comparatively low when compared to universities of other
                countries. This is
                also one of the reasons for competitive admission in universities. Students who want a job can enroll
                themselves in
                community colleges and technical institutions, as the vocational programmes offered by them last for one
                to three years.

            </ul>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Qualifications Valued Around the World:</h5>
            <p>Canada’s high academic standards and rigorous quality controls mean that you’ll be earning a high-quality
                education that
                will open doors for your future and benefit your career over the long term. A Canadian degree, diploma
                or certificate is
                globally recognized as being equivalent to those obtained from the United States or Commonwealth
                countries</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Affordable Education:</h5>
            <p>The quality of education and living standards in Canada are amongst the highest in the world, but the
                cost of living and
                tuition fees for international students are generally lower than in other countries such as the United
                States and the
                United Kingdom. As such, Canada is often the preferred choice for students attending college or
                university.</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Multicultural Society:</h5>
            <p>With almost all of the world’s ethnic groups represented in Canada, it’s hard not to find ethnic foods
                and recreation
                activities associated with specific cultures. In fact, your international student advisor can help you
                get in touch with
                any number of ethnic clubs and associations for you to join while you’re here.</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Healthy and Safe Communities:</h5>
            <p>While you may have heard of or experienced Canadians’ friendly and open nature, you may not have known
                that the United
                Nations consistently ranks Canada as one of the best places in the world to live. As an international
                student in Canada,
                you’ll enjoy all of the same freedoms which protect Canadians – respect for human rights, equality, and
                a stable and
                peaceful society.</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">World-Class Language Education:</h5>
            <p>Did you know that Canada is a bilingual country and is considered a world leader in language training?
                Since teaching
                French and English as a first and second language is an integral part of a Canadian education, you will
                be able to
                improve your fluency and capacity for either language as you further your studies.</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Exciting Campus Lifestyle:</h5>
            <p>Canada’s post-secondary campuses aren’t only wired with the latest in sophisticated technology, but
                countless other
                modern amenities as well. From Olympic-quality sports facilities to public concert halls and art
                galleries, Canada’s
                post-secondary campuses offer you enormous possibilities for learning and leisure. Plus, you’ll have
                incredible
                opportunities to meet like-minded individuals and gain valuable experience through student-run
                governments, radio,
                newspapers and businesses.</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Innovative and Abundant Research Opportunities:</h5>
            <p>Since research is one of the key components of a Canadian post-secondary education, you’ll have ample
                opportunity to
                become a part of this vibrant aspect of education. In Canada, government and industry together support
                research
                including: telecommunications, medicine, agriculture, computer technology, and environmental science.
            </p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Land of Possibilities:</h5>
            <p>Under Canada’s highly dynamic and hands-on academic environment, you will not only acquire knowledge and
                skills in
                analysis and communication, but you will also learn how to express yourself, demonstrate your
                creativity, and develop
                your self-confidence! Teachers and professors are always available and eager to help with lessons, and
                studies fuse
                academic excellence with interaction and collaboration in the classroom.</p>
            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">Possibility of Immigration:</h5>
            <p>Did you know that some international students with Canadian credentials and Canadian work experience may
                apply for
                permanent residency without having to leave Canada? For more information about the possibility of
                immigration to Canada
                once your schooling is complete, please visit the Citizenship and Immigration Canada website.</p>

                    International Student
                    Assessment (PISA).</li>
                <li>More than one third of Canada’s research is conducted at Canadian universities – one of the highest
                    rates among OECD and
                    G8 countries.</li>



            </ul>


            <p class="pb-2">Canada is one of the world’s top education performers and is the top OECD country in
                spending per student on public
                postsecondary education. Students score high on international tests reflecting the dedication each
                jurisdiction has on
                the quality of our education system.
            </p>


            <p class="pb-2">In Canada, post-secondary education is the responsibility of provincial and territorial
                governments, and in each
                province and territory there are laws, policies and procedures that govern the operation of education
                institutions. The
                basic structures of provincial and territorial education systems across Canada are similar. Each has 3
                tiers —
                elementary, secondary, and postsecondary; all provide universal, free elementary and secondary schooling
                for Canadian
                students.
            </p>


            <p class="pb-2">Each jurisdiction has its own quality assurance mechanisms that are used in combination to
                ensure quality in the
                country’s wide range of post-secondary institutions (Canadian Information Centre for International
                Credentials, 2011).
                This ensures Canada’s academic credentials continue to be valued worldwide.

            <p class=""><b>Application Fees</b></p>
            <p>Each university has different application fees such as 150 CAN$ /200 CAN$ which could be waived during
                events like Spot
                Admissions organized by Pacific global network Ltd. At spot admissions events, students also get an
                opportunity to meet
                university representatives personally.</p>
