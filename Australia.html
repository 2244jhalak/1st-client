            <h5 style="color: rgb(204,12,12);">About Australia</h5>
            <hr class="pb-2" style="width: 150px;">
            <p class="pb-2">Did you know Australia is the world’s sixth largest country by total area and
                has the third
                highest
                number of
                international students in the world behind only the United Kingdom and the United States
                despite having
                a population of
                only 23 million? This isn’t surprising when you consider Australia has seven of the top 100
                universities
                in the world!
                In fact, with over 22,000 courses across 1,100 institutions, Australia sits above the likes
                of Germany,
                the Netherlands
                and Japan, ranking eighth in the Universitas 2012 U21 Ranking of National Higher Education
                Systems.
                Their gross domestic
                product (GDP) $46,631 per capita and gross national product (GNP) $62,822 per capita.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                Australia has five of the 30 best cities in the world for students based on student mix,
                affordability,
                quality of life,
                and employer activity – all important elements for students when choosing the best study
                destination.
                And with more than
                A$200 million provided by the Australian Government each year in international scholarships,
                we’re
                making it easier for
                you to come and experience the difference an Australian education can make to your future
                career
                opportunities.
            </p>
            <ul class="pb-2">
                <li>Climate</li>
                <li>Nearly a third of Australia is in the tropics and the rest is in the temperate zone.
                </li>
                <li>Main Cities ( Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth )</li>
                <li>Regional Cities ( Adelaide, Toowoomba, Armidale, Townsville, Darwin, Hobart etc; )</li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Culture & Multiculturism</b></p>
            <p>While Australians love their sport, they also have a special affinity for the arts. From
                cinema,
                literature and music to
                theatre, dance and the visual arts, Australia’s varied cities are rich in culture.
                Australian culture
                wouldn’t be what
                it is without its multicultural dimension. Australia continues to benefit from its
                multicultural make-up
                – one of the
                most diverse in the world – enjoying a wealth of ideas, cuisines and lifestyles. The last
                census
                reported that 33% of
                the population is foreign-born, and over 60% of Australians are of mixed cultural origins.
                Every four
                minutes and eight
                seconds Australia gains another international immigrant.</p>
            <p><b>Transport</b></p>
            <p class="pb-5">Australian cities have excellent public and private transport systems, making
                travelling
                around them
                simple and fast.</p>

            <hr class="pb-2" style="width: 200px;">
            <ul class="pb-5">
                <li>Australia has the third largest number of international students in the English-speaking
                    world after
                    the USA and UK. In
                    some countries Australia is the students’ first choice study destination.</li>
                <li>Australian qualifications and institutions are recognized globally for their high
                    quality and
                    excellence. Graduates from
                    Australia are very successful in finding jobs and hold prominent positions worldwide.
                    Additionally,
                    they are readily
                    accepted for postgraduate study at leading international universities.</li>
                <li>More than 2,80,000 international students from over 195 countries are studying at
                    Australian
                    universities. This is about
                    half of all international students enrolled in Australian courses. The terms University
                    and Degree
                    are protected in
                    Australia so that only institutions which meet Australia’s rigorous quality assurance
                    processes can
                    use the titles.</li>
                <li>Australia has 39 universities which are listed on the registers of the Australian
                    Qualifications
                    Framework as well as a
                    number of recognized higher education institutions. Australian universities also have
                    overseas
                    branch campuses, twinning
                    arrangements and exchange programmes for students and staff worldwide. Australia has
                    nearly 4000
                    formal agreements with
                    universities around the world.</li>
                <li>Many Australian universities concentrate on traditional areas of learning and inquiry,
                    while others
                    are more vocational
                    and applied in focus. All, to some extent, combine tuition with research</li>
                <li>It is Australia’s reputation as an innovative and research-intensive culture that is
                    attracting many
                    international
                    students at the postgraduate level. Australia’s expenditure on research and development
                    ranks highly
                    among OECD
                    countries.</li>

            <p class=""><b>Universities</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">The university level of education is the highest level of education in
                Australia. A student
                can study either at the
                undergraduate level or the postgraduate level in a university. In Australia a student will
                be expected
                to conduct
                independent research at all institutions, especially at university. You can choose from a
                vast range of
                courses
                including traditional academic areas of learning and research, as well as more practical
                courses with a
                vocational
                orientation. Generally universities follow semester system and for some programs, they have
                trimester
                system.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>Vocational</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">Vocational courses are offered by government funded TAFE (Technical and Further
                Education)
                institutes and also by some
                private colleges. These institutions are closely linked with the industry so the courses are
                practical
                and skilled
                based. In Australia’s vocational education and training institutions you will gain
                career-focused skills
                that are valued
                and sought by employers. You can step directly into a career or use your vocational studies
                as a pathway
                to university.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>School</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">It is compulsory for children aged between 6 and 15, with matriculation exams
                for university
                generally at 18 years old.
                Australian schools are public and private.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>English Language Institutes</b></p>

                on the
                respective university’s website, university brochures or from our counselors. Some
