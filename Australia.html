            <hr class="pb-2" style="width: 150px;">
            <p class="pb-2">Did you know Australia is the world’s sixth largest country by total area and has the third
                highest
                number of
                international students in the world behind only the United Kingdom and the United States despite having
                a population of
                only 23 million? This isn’t surprising when you consider Australia has seven of the top 100 universities
                in the world!
                In fact, with over 22,000 courses across 1,100 institutions, Australia sits above the likes of Germany,
                the Netherlands
                and Japan, ranking eighth in the Universitas 2012 U21 Ranking of National Higher Education Systems.
                Their gross domestic
                product (GDP) $46,631 per capita and gross national product (GNP) $62,822 per capita.</p>
            <p class="pb-2">
                Australia has five of the 30 best cities in the world for students based on student mix, affordability,
                quality of life,
                and employer activity – all important elements for students when choosing the best study destination.
                And with more than
                A$200 million provided by the Australian Government each year in international scholarships, we’re
                making it easier for
                you to come and experience the difference an Australian education can make to your future career
                opportunities.
            </p>
            <ul class="pb-2">
                <li>Climate</li>
                <li>Nearly a third of Australia is in the tropics and the rest is in the temperate zone.</li>
                <li>Main Cities ( Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth )</li>
                <li>Regional Cities ( Adelaide, Toowoomba, Armidale, Townsville, Darwin, Hobart etc; )</li>

            </ul>
            <p><b>Culture & Multiculturism</b></p>
            <p>While Australians love their sport, they also have a special affinity for the arts. From cinema,
                literature and music to
                theatre, dance and the visual arts, Australia’s varied cities are rich in culture. Australian culture
                wouldn’t be what
                it is without its multicultural dimension. Australia continues to benefit from its multicultural make-up
                – one of the
                most diverse in the world – enjoying a wealth of ideas, cuisines and lifestyles. The last census
                reported that 33% of
                the population is foreign-born, and over 60% of Australians are of mixed cultural origins. Every four
                minutes and eight
                seconds Australia gains another international immigrant.</p>
            <p><b>Transport</b></p>
            <p class="pb-5">Australian cities have excellent public and private transport systems, making travelling
                around them
                simple and fast.</p>

            <hr class="pb-2" style="width: 200px;">
            <ul class="pb-5">
                <li>Australia has the third largest number of international students in the English-speaking world after
                    the USA and UK. In
                    some countries Australia is the students’ first choice study destination.</li>
                <li>Australian qualifications and institutions are recognized globally for their high quality and
                    excellence. Graduates from
                    Australia are very successful in finding jobs and hold prominent positions worldwide. Additionally,
                    they are readily
                    accepted for postgraduate study at leading international universities.</li>
                <li>More than 2,80,000 international students from over 195 countries are studying at Australian
                    universities. This is about
                    half of all international students enrolled in Australian courses. The terms University and Degree
                    are protected in
                    Australia so that only institutions which meet Australia’s rigorous quality assurance processes can
                    use the titles.</li>
                <li>Australia has 39 universities which are listed on the registers of the Australian Qualifications
                    Framework as well as a
                    number of recognized higher education institutions. Australian universities also have overseas
                    branch campuses, twinning
                    arrangements and exchange programmes for students and staff worldwide. Australia has nearly 4000
                    formal agreements with
                    universities around the world.</li>
                <li>Many Australian universities concentrate on traditional areas of learning and inquiry, while others
                    are more vocational
                    and applied in focus. All, to some extent, combine tuition with research</li>
                <li>It is Australia’s reputation as an innovative and research-intensive culture that is attracting many
                    international
                    students at the postgraduate level. Australia’s expenditure on research and development ranks highly
                    among OECD
                    countries.</li>

            <p class=""><b>Universities</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">The university level of education is the highest level of education in Australia. A student
                can study either at the
                undergraduate level or the postgraduate level in a university. In Australia a student will be expected
                to conduct
                independent research at all institutions, especially at university. You can choose from a vast range of
                courses
                including traditional academic areas of learning and research, as well as more practical courses with a
                vocational
                orientation. Generally universities follow semester system and for some programs, they have trimester
                system.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>Vocational</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">Vocational courses are offered by government funded TAFE (Technical and Further Education)
                institutes and also by some
                private colleges. These institutions are closely linked with the industry so the courses are practical
                and skilled
                based. In Australia’s vocational education and training institutions you will gain career-focused skills
                that are valued
                and sought by employers. You can step directly into a career or use your vocational studies as a pathway
                to university.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>School</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">It is compulsory for children aged between 6 and 15, with matriculation exams for university
                generally at 18 years old.
                Australian schools are public and private.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>English Language Institutes</b></p>

            <p class="pb-5">Specialist English language tuition is offered by more than 210 institutions located all
                over Australia, in major cities
                as well as country centers.

            <p class=""><b>Intakes</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">The main intake for all Australian Institutions is February. All universities have
                admissions open for all courses in
                this intake. There is also a Mid-year intake offered by some Australian Universities during July.
                However, all courses
                may not be offered in this intake. Whether or not a University will offer a July intake can be found out
                on the
                respective university’s website, university brochures or from our counselors. Some universities also
                follow November –
                summer intake. It is available only for limited number of universities and limited courses.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>Application Fees</b></p>

            <p class="pb-2">Each university has different application fees which could be waived during events like Spot
                Admissions organized by
                Pacific global network. At spot admissions events, students also get an opportunity to meet university
                representatives
                personally.
            </p>
            <p class=""><b>Processing Time</b></p>

            <p class="pb-5">The service standard for both paper and eVisa applications standard is 90 days for
                Assessment Level 1. We aim to process
                75 per cent of cases within these service standards, however individually the actual processing time may
                vary from these
                standards for various reasons. Source – www.immi.gov.au
